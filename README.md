Optical flow is defined by the apparent motion of individual pixels on the image plane. It is a 2D velocity field, representing the apparent 2D image motion of pixels from the reference image to the target image. The task can be defined as follows: Given two images $img_1 ,img_2 \in R^{H\times W \times 3}$, the flow field $U \in R^{H\times W \times 2}$ describes the horizontal and vertical image motion between $img_1 ,img_2$. \\

Optical flow estimation is considered a good approximation of objectsâ€™ real physical motion projected onto the image plane [1]. It has significant applications in the autonomous vehicle field, as it can provide 3D object motion information used for scene understanding, obstacle avoidance or path planning.
